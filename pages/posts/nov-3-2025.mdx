To the reader who cared to enter this post,

It's up from my stomach on top of my throat already. Why is it so tough to get into big tech in China as an international? Well I do know what I need, but I keep not having it over time, again and again and again. I asked many friends who have interned in big tech about their experience, I got my resume checked. Many friends claimed that I've done a lot of stuff over the years, and it's quite, even competitive for big tech internship applications. However, the basic requirements are to be able to communicate fluently in Chinese language and perform well in technical interviews. Some friends claimed that I should try applying for international companies, but international companies are crazy competitive, that you cannot get into them without connection, or they just prefer someone withchinese fluency over you no matter how competitive you are. Over the years, I decided my best to have a competitive resume for big techs through school jobs and projects, but didn't care to learn chinese language properly. It is time to fix this. I may end up taking a gap year but I WILL get the Chinese big tech experience however it takes.

I will be learning chinese language and solving leetcode problems every day. I am currently in HSK 3 course book, and have solved problems in various platforms, currently 77 on leetcode.
