To the reader who cared to enter this post,

It's up from my stomach on top of my throat already. Why is it so tough to get into big tech in China as a foreigner? Well I do know what I need, but I keep not having it over time, again and again and again. I asked many friends who have interned in big tech about their experience, I got my resume checked many times. Many friends claimed that I've done a lot of stuff over the years, and it's quite competitive for big tech internship applications. However, the basic requirements are still there, that is, to be able to communicate fluently in Chinese language and perform well in technical interviews. Some friends suggested me to try applying for international companies, but international companies just prefer someone with chinese fluency over you no matter how competitive you are. Over the years, I decided my best to have a competitive resume for big tech through school jobs and projects, but didn't care to learn chinese language properly. It is time to fix this.

I will be learning chinese language and solving leetcode problems every day. I am currently in HSK 3 course book, and have solved problems in various platforms, currently 77 on leetcode.
